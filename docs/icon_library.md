# HD44780 Icon Library (Public Domain Source)

This catalog mirrors the custom-character glyphs published in [duinoWitchery/hd44780 — LCDCustomChars.ino](https://github.com/duinoWitchery/hd44780/blob/master/examples/ioClass/hd44780_I2Clcd/LCDCustomChars/LCDCustomChars.ino) by Bill Perry (2016-10-06). The upstream file declares that the example code and bitmaps are **released into the public domain**. LifelineTTY copies the glyph rows verbatim so they can be embedded directly in `src/payload/icons.rs` and referenced by Milestone H.

## Vertical signal bars (0–8)

These glyphs represent a vertical RSSI-style bar graph. Slot `0` is blank; slot `8` is fully lit. The arrays are copied verbatim from the upstream `vsigbar` table.

| Bars lit | Row bytes |
|----------|-----------|
| 0 | `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00` |
| 1 | `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x1f` |
| 2 | `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x1f,0x1f` |
| 3 | `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` |
| 4 | `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` |
| 5 | `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` |
| 6 | `0x00,0x00,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` |
| 7 | `0x00,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` |
| 8 | `0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f,0x1f` |

## Usage notes

- Each row byte maps directly to HD44780 CGRAM rows (bit 0 = leftmost pixel). Keep strings ≤16 columns and remember that the controller exposes only eight custom slots (`0x00`–`0x07`).
- When embedding these icons in payloads today, use octal escapes (`"\\000"` → slot 0). Milestone H will provide semantic names so operators can avoid manual escapes.
- If you add new icons, update this file **and** the corresponding Rust registry; tests introduced with Milestone H will assert that both stay in sync.

## Overlay icon usage

The LifelineTTY runtime now virtualizes CGRAM through the IconBank, so any name defined in this
catalog can be referenced from the payload’s `icons` array. Each render pass can stage up to eight
custom glyphs. The stacked bar graph and heartbeat overlay consume part of that budget when they
are enabled, and any additional icons in the payload fall back to their ASCII placeholder (with a
debug log entry) so the LCD never displays stale glyphs.

Include the names directly in your payload (e.g., `{ "schema_version":1, "icons":["wifi","battery"] }`). Unknown names are ignored so misspelled entries simply drop out of the render pass. The runtime regenerates CGRAM data before every write, so you no longer need to embed raw `\x00` bytes or worry about slot ordering across frames.
